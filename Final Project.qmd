#### How do key financial variables (assets, income, revenue) differ across nonprofit mission types, and what patterns emerge from exploratory data analysis?
To begin the analysis, we used exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques introduced in STAT 515 to examine how nonprofit financial characteristics vary across National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) mission categories. Because nonprofit financial variables tend to be highly right-skewed, we applied log-scaled violin and boxplot visualizations, which help reveal distributional patterns and reduce the influence of extreme outliers.

Across the mission types, both asset levels and income levels show substantial variation, with several categories displaying consistently higher medians and wider spreads. For example, groups in categories such as Education (B) and Health (E) tend to have noticeably larger asset bases and higher incomes compared to categories like Arts (A) or Youth (O), which have narrower distributions and lower medians. These patterns suggest that nonprofit sectors differ systematically in operational scale and financial capacity.

We also examined the Revenue-to-Income ratio, a financial structure metric that indicates how closely an organization’s revenue aligns with reported income. Although most mission categories cluster around similar ratios, the spread within each category is large, reflecting diverse funding models and reporting practices even among similar mission types. Some categories show a heavier tail toward higher ratios, indicating subgroups of organizations with unusually strong revenue performance compared to income.

Together, these EDA results demonstrate clear financial differences across mission types and provide important context for the modeling conducted in later sections. Understanding these baseline patterns is a key step in exploratory analytics and helps justify the inclusion of financial variables in predictive models used in Research Questions 2–4.

#### To what extent do standardized financial indicators predict whether an organization belongs to top NTEE mission categories?
To evaluate whether financial characteristics are predictive of mission type, we fit binary logistic regression models for five of the most common NTEE major groups (A, B, P, N, X). All financial variables were standardized prior to modeling to improve interpretability and model stability. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were computed for each predictor to assess the direction and magnitude of associations.

Because the distribution of NTEE classes is highly imbalanced, we also implemented oversampling (caret::upSample) to create balanced datasets and re-fit each logistic model. This step allows us to compare performance under equal class representation and reduces bias in predictive accuracy. Model accuracy was evaluated using confusion matrices applied to the balanced samples.

The logistic regression models show that financial variables have statistically meaningful associations with mission type, although the magnitude and direction of effects differ across categories. Standardized income and revenue are strong positive predictors for several mission groups—particularly Education (B) and Human Services (P)—indicating that these sectors tend to include organizations with larger operational scale. The revenue-to-income ratio is also influential in multiple models, suggesting that financial structure, not just size, is tied to mission classification.

After correcting for class imbalance with oversampling, model accuracy ranges between approximately 70% and 90%, depending on the category. This indicates that financial characteristics alone provide moderate discriminatory power but do not fully explain mission classification, which is expected because mission type reflects organizational purpose rather than purely financial attributes.

#### Which financial indicators most strongly predict an organization’s foundation classification type?

The multinomial logistic regression model achieved modest predictive accuracy, indicating that although financial measures differ across foundation types, they do not fully explain classification. Coefficients for variables such as Log Revenue Dependence and Log Liquidity were significant for several foundation categories, suggesting that the way organizations generate and use financial resources correlates with foundation type.

The random forest model performed similarly in overall accuracy but offered deeper insight through variable importance. The model identified revenue, assets, and liquidity as the most influential predictors. This indicates that financial scale and financial structure play meaningful roles in distinguishing different foundation classifications.

The decision tree provides a simple visual summary of how financial thresholds split organizations into distinct types. Early splits on asset amount and liquidity suggest that foundational categorization often reflects differences in organizational size and financial reserves.

Overall, the results show that financial characteristics contribute meaningfully to foundation classification, though they are not the sole determinants.

## Queation 4

#### Which organizational characteristics best predict whether a nonprofit earns high revenue?

The logistic regression model shows that financial structure strongly predicts whether an organization has high revenue. Higher revenue dependence, higher liquidity, and lower asset-to-income ratios significantly increase the odds of belonging to the high-revenue group. Several foundation types also exhibit meaningful differences, indicating that organizational structure influences revenue-generating patterns.

The random forest model achieved excellent predictive accuracy (~97%), confirming that financial scale variables such as revenue and assets dominate in classification. Variable importance results highlight revenue amount as the single strongest predictor, followed by assets, accounting period, and mission type.

The state effects model shows that location also has a significant influence on revenue levels. Some states have odds of high revenue 15–30% above or below the national norm, even after controlling for financial features. This suggests structural or policy differences in regional nonprofit ecosystems.

Together, these results demonstrate that both financial characteristics and geographic context play important roles in predicting high-revenue organizations.
