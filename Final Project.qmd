## Introduction 


## Queation 1
#### Which organizational characteristics most strongly predict whether a nonprofit is high-revenue?

To determine how factors such as mission type (NTEE major group), organizational structure (group-affiliated vs standalone), geography (state), financial attributes (assets, revenue), and fiscal year-end month contribute to predicting whether a nonprofit has income above the median for the year 2024.


	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Random Forest
	•	KNN

## Queation 2
####To what extent does geography (state-level location) influence whether a nonprofit is high-revenue?

Test whether revenue patterns vary significantly by state and whether geography is a meaningful predictor after controlling for other factors.


	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Tree
	•	Random Forest

## Queation 3
#### Does mission type (NTEE major group) significantly influence whether a nonprofit is high-revenue?

Focus on how mission category (Arts, Education, Health, Human Services, Religion, etc.) contributes to financial performance.


	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Tree / Random Forest
	•	KNN (optional)

## Queation 4
#### Do group-affiliated nonprofits differ from standalone nonprofits in their likelihood of being high-revenue?

Examine whether belonging to a parent organization (group ruling) affects financial capacity

	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Decision Tree
	•	Random Forest<br>

## Queation 5
#### Can a nonprofit’s mission type (NTEE major group) be predicted using its financial indicators and organizational attributes?

Flip the previous questions: instead of predicting income from mission, predict mission from financial structure.


	•	Multinomial Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest
	•	KNN
	
<br>

## Queation 6
#### Are organizational characteristics able to predict whether a nonprofit has a high asset-to-revenue ratio?

Look at financial efficiency or stability instead of raw income.


Same classification models.
