My name is Veronica Wood. I earned a B.S. in Business Management from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2019, and I’m excited to learn more with a MS in Data Analytics Engineering program.

I have always been interested by the stories that data can tell and how those insights can drive meaningful improvement. My interest grew further during my role as a Budget Analyst for the Department of Defense, where I provide analysis across multiple financial portfolios.

I believe that pursuing the MS DAEN degree will provide me with a more well-rounded foundation in data analysis and position me for continued growth in the field.
