    "text": "Queation 1\n\nHow do key financial variables (assets, income, revenue) differ across nonprofit mission types, and what patterns emerge from exploratory data analysis?\nTo begin the analysis, we used exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques introduced in STAT 515 to examine how nonprofit financial characteristics vary across National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) mission categories. Because nonprofit financial variables tend to be highly right-skewed, we applied log-scaled violin and boxplot visualizations, which help reveal distributional patterns and reduce the influence of extreme outliers.\nAcross the mission types, both asset levels and income levels show substantial variation, with several categories displaying consistently higher medians and wider spreads. For example, groups in categories such as Education (B) and Health (E) tend to have noticeably larger asset bases and higher incomes compared to categories like Arts (A) or Youth (O), which have narrower distributions and lower medians. These patterns suggest that nonprofit sectors differ systematically in operational scale and financial capacity.\nWe also examined the Revenue-to-Income ratio, a financial structure metric that indicates how closely an organization’s revenue aligns with reported income. Although most mission categories cluster around similar ratios, the spread within each category is large, reflecting diverse funding models and reporting practices even among similar mission types. Some categories show a heavier tail toward higher ratios, indicating subgroups of organizations with unusually strong revenue performance compared to income.\nTogether, these EDA results demonstrate clear financial differences across mission types and provide important context for the modeling conducted in later sections. Understanding these baseline patterns is a key step in exploratory analytics and helps justify the inclusion of financial variables in predictive models used in Research Questions 2–4.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Distribution of Revenue-to-Income ratios across NTEE mission categories on a log scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Log-scaled violin and boxplots showing the distribution of total assets for nonprofits across NTEE mission categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Log-scaled income distributions for nonprofits by NTEE mission category."
