I earned a B.S. in Business Management from Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) in 2019, and I’m excited to learn more with a MS in Data Analytics Engineering program.\nI have always been interested by the stories that data can tell and how those insights can drive meaningful improvement. My interest grew further during my role as a Budget Analyst for the Department of Defense, where I provide analysis across multiple financial portfolios.\nI believe that pursuing the MS DAEN degree will provide me with a more well-rounded foundation in data analysis and position me for continued growth in the field."
